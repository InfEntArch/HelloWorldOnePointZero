To learn about GitHub
Notes: 
Tutorial section "To create a new branch" tells you to "Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master."
Well 20 minutes later and I am still looking for it !
OK so a bit of an exageration but had to resort to looking on StackOverFlow and the screen shot helped me find it instantly.
The issue for me was "file list " creates an expcetion of a sort of dialog object which is unlike the file list in question.
