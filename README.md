To learn about GitHub  
Notes:    
Tutorial section "To create a new branch" tells you to "Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: master."
Well 20 minutes later and I am still looking for it !
OK so a bit of an exageration but had to resort to looking on StackOverFlow and the screen shot helped me find it instantly.
The issue for me was "file list " creates an expectation of a sort of dialog object which is unlike the file list in question.<br />
So pleased to learn \<br/\> or two spaces at the end of a line cause a carriage return line feed in this HTML rendering system. It's called Markdown, but note GitHub may have it's own flavour.
